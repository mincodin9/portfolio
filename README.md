# Personal Portfolio Website
by Sumin Lee

![Portfolio Preview](./assets/portfolio-preview.png)

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website built to present my projects, experience,
and approach to front-end development in a clear and interactive way.

Rather than focusing on static layouts, I aimed to create a site that feels alive,
while keeping the structure simple and readable.

## Live Site

## Key Sections

- **Header / Navigation**
  - Simple and consistent navigation structure
  - Responsive layout across screen sizes

- **Hero Section**
  - Interactive canvas-based wave animation
  - Subtle character movement reacting to user input

- **About Section**
  - Brief personal introduction and background
  - Clean layout focused on readability

- **Experience Section**
  - Overview of development experience and training
  - Emphasis on practical projects and responsibilities

- **Projects Section**
  - Highlight cards with slide-based transitions
  - Clear presentation of individual projects and roles

## Interaction & Motion
- Canvas-based wave animation using the HTML Canvas API
- Time-based animation loop with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Slide animations for project highlight cards
- Smooth easing and motion to avoid abrupt transitions

## What I Focused On
- Building a portfolio that communicates clearly within a few seconds
- Keeping animations subtle and intentional, not decorative
- Structuring components so that interactions don’t complicate the layout
- Writing readable code with clear intent

## Tech Stack
- React (Next.js)
- TypeScript
- HTML Canvas API
- CSS Modules

## Notes
This portfolio is an evolving project.
Some features are intentionally minimal to keep the focus on structure,
interaction, and clarity rather than visual complexity.
